# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: July 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Redesigned the deck list importer and refactored code to accommodate these changes.  Still need to get my user story to pass but have all other unittests passing.

**Thoughts:** Working with 3rd party APIs can be tough.  I can't figure out why one of my queries isn't returning correctly when everything else is.  Also had some super weird issues with namespaces in my unittests that caused a bunch of problems.

### Day 1: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the model for delirium checker in MTG_Tools.

**Thoughts:** There are some efficiency problems.  It is making an HTTP API call way too often.  Solution is to do the calls once and store the card objects and then use those in the model.
