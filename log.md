# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: August 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Figured out kwargs, added some comments, refactored code, and got 0 warnings on inspection.  This project should be done unless someone wants something else done with it.  

**Thoughts:** I think some of the errors I may have had a few days ago with the weird unittest results could have been from me being cute with how I was declaring class variables.  I could also advertise this project a bit on reddit.

### Day 4: July 31th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Optimized code, got all tests to pass, and added documentation. 

**Thoughts:** I realize that yesterday I said I was finished but that was just because the code worked as intended.  I cleaned up a bunch of the loose threads today and want to use this code to figure out how to do optional named keywords in python.

### Day 3: July 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Got program to work correctly.  The model is verified by math as shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/5eaf7r/standard_what_is_the_chance_to_hit_delirium_off/).  Also reduced program runtime from 5+ hours to about 30 seconds.

**Thoughts:** Program runs good enough but there are still some issues I could tackle as shown in the todo list.  These issues would improve the quality of the code for future use and make it easier to work on it while also teaching me a bit more about unittests.  I will consider this project done for now.

### Day 2: July 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Redesigned the deck list importer and refactored code to accommodate these changes.  Still need to get my user story to pass but have all other unittests passing.

**Thoughts:** Working with 3rd party APIs can be tough.  I can't figure out why one of my queries isn't returning correctly when everything else is.  Also had some super weird issues with namespaces in my unittests that caused a bunch of problems.

### Day 1: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the model for delirium checker in MTG_Tools.

**Thoughts:** There are some efficiency problems.  It is making an HTTP API call way too often.  Solution is to do the calls once and store the card objects and then use those in the model.

### Day 0: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited the project files to align the scope of this challenge with what I want to be doing.

**Thoughts:** I am looking forward to beginning this challenge.
