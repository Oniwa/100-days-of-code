### Day 24: September 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the third chapter of TDD with Python

**Thoughts:** Still covering things I have previously done.  Checked out whether virtualenvwrapper-win works in git bash, it does not.  Got a new console , ConsoleZ, it is an upgraded and maintained Console2.

### Day 23: September 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first two chapters of TDD with Python

**Thoughts:** The first two chapters went smoothly.  The tough part was in figuring out how to start over on the project in the github repo I had already started while converting that repo to a git flow workflow.

### Day 22: September 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Got my python environment upgraded and set up to begin TDD with Python.

**Thoughts:** Spent a bunch of time fighting with getting my environment set up but I succeeded.  Tomorrow I should be able to start actual work again!

**Link to work:** NA

### Day 21: August 22st, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished Python Koans, well all but the extra credit assignment.

**Thoughts:** I do not see the need for proxy classes in python, nor do I really understand it.  It seems to be a topic that isn't used all too much.

**Link to work:** [Python Koans](https://github.com/Oniwa/python_koans)

### Day 20: August 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Using my mtg tools library I made a program to analyze the percent chance to draw the nut hand from a GR Vengevine deck for my friend.

**Thoughts:** I thought I would have to make some adjustments to my mtg tool library but was able to do the model without having to.

### Day 19: August 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Using my mtg tools library I made a program to analyze the percent chance to draw a specific 3 of card by a specific turn.

**Thoughts:** Someone on reddit got me salty so I used this to find the data to make my claim.

### Day 18: August 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took 9 more steps towards enlightenment on Python Koans.

**Thoughts:** Only 3 more steps left.  Learned some cool stuff about inheritance, decorators, and attribute access.  Excited to finish the koans up!

### Day 17: August 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took 7 more steps towards enlightenment on Python Koans.

**Thoughts:** Only 12 more steps left.  Learned some interesting behaivors about mmonkey patching and how to manipulate classes and functions.  Although I don't think they are super useful in practice, I would much rather just edit the function or class than monkey patch or mess with bindings.

### Day 16: August 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took 6 more steps towards enlightenment on Python Koans.

**Thoughts:** I did not want to work on my exorcism project so worked on Koans instead.  Learned some new stuff about iterators and generators.

### Day 15: August 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the say project for exercism.io

**Thoughts:** I am not liking my implementation of the say program.  I am going to mull over some ways to make it better and more reusable.

**Link to work:** [Exercism.io](https://github.com/Oniwa/exercism.io)

### Day 14: August 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished sum of multiples and acronym projects on exorcism.io.  Refactored robot simulator from idea I got from looking at someone elses code on exercism.io.  Took 2 more steps towards enlightenment on Python Koans.

**Thoughts:** Glancing at other peoples code on exercism.io is a neat way to see other implementations and some of them are better.  Is using regular expressions pythonic?

### Day 13: August 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished atbash cypher and sieve of Eratosthenes projects on exorcism.io.  Refactored rotational cypher from comments given on exercism.io

**Thoughts:** I enjoy constructive crticism.  Using from string import ascii_lowercase to do alphabet manipulation was much easier than doing all of the dictionary stuff.

**Link to work:** [Exercism.io](https://github.com/Oniwa/exercism.io)

### Day 12: August 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished robot simulator project on exorcism.io

**Thoughts:** Never thought I would find something I liked in C better than python but being able to do unsigned integer math easily is nice.

**Link to work:** [Exercism.io](https://github.com/Oniwa/exercism.io)

### Day 11: August 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished series project on exorcism.io and took 3 steps towards enlightenment with Python Koans

**Thoughts:** Learned about tuples and more list comprehensions today.  I do not use list comprehensions enough!

### Day 10: August 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished allergies and difference of squares projects on exorcism.io and took 4 steps towards enlightenment with Python Koans

**Thoughts:** Played with list comprehensions and binary numbers!

### Day 9: August 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished meetup and rotational cypher projects on exorcism.io

**Thoughts:** Learned more about datetimes and dictionaries.

**Link to work:** [Exercism.io](https://github.com/Oniwa/exercism.io)

### Day 8: August 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Titanic Kaggle tutorial.  Finished a run-length-encoder for exercism.io.

**Thoughts:** I have soooo much to learn about data science but it seems so interesting!  I will come back to that at a later time.  Worked on some exercism.io stuff for fun.

### Day 7: August 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Installed jupyter notebooks and reran the craft beer analysis script.  The visualizations and report worked in jupyter notebooks.  Started the kaggle Titanic tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Always remember to activate your virtual environment before installing packages.  Jupyter notebook looks pretty sweet.

### Day 6: August 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Got scipy and numpy isntalled on my machine.  Finished the second part of a tutorial I had been working on but need to redo it in a jupyter notebook some other time. 

**Thoughts:** Why is it such a pain to get scipy and numpy working on windows in 2017!?

### Day 5: August 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Figured out kwargs, added some comments, refactored code, and got 0 warnings on inspection.  This project should be done unless someone wants something else done with it.  

**Thoughts:** I think some of the errors I may have had a few days ago with the weird unittest results could have been from me being cute with how I was declaring class variables.  I could also advertise this project a bit on reddit.

### Day 4: July 31th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Optimized code, got all tests to pass, and added documentation. 

**Thoughts:** I realize that yesterday I said I was finished but that was just because the code worked as intended.  I cleaned up a bunch of the loose threads today and want to use this code to figure out how to do optional named keywords in python.

### Day 3: July 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Got program to work correctly.  The model is verified by math as shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/5eaf7r/standard_what_is_the_chance_to_hit_delirium_off/).  Also reduced program runtime from 5+ hours to about 30 seconds.

**Thoughts:** Program runs good enough but there are still some issues I could tackle as shown in the todo list.  These issues would improve the quality of the code for future use and make it easier to work on it while also teaching me a bit more about unittests.  I will consider this project done for now.

### Day 2: July 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Redesigned the deck list importer and refactored code to accommodate these changes.  Still need to get my user story to pass but have all other unittests passing.

**Thoughts:** Working with 3rd party APIs can be tough.  I can't figure out why one of my queries isn't returning correctly when everything else is.  Also had some super weird issues with namespaces in my unittests that caused a bunch of problems.

**Link to work:** [mtg_tools](https://github.com/Oniwa/mtg_tools)

### Day 1: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the model for delirium checker in MTG_Tools.

**Thoughts:** There are some efficiency problems.  It is making an HTTP API call way too often.  Solution is to do the calls once and store the card objects and then use those in the model.

### Day 0: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited the project files to align the scope of this challenge with what I want to be doing.

**Thoughts:** I am looking forward to beginning this challenge.
